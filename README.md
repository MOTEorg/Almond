# Machine learning for small datasets
Probability is easy when the density distribution is normal. This is almost always true for large amounts of data. But, small datasets usually do not have a normal distribution, then machine learning help us to find some good distribution for them.

+ **A**: Artificial
+ **L**: Learning
+ **M**: Machines
+ **O**: Overtaking
+ **N**: Normal 
+ **D**: Distribution

Almonds are not in all chocolate bars. Moreover the chocolates with almonds usually have them in a very small proportion. Then, find the almond in a chocolate is similar to find the meaning in a small dataset.
